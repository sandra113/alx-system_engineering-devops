-A 3 is an option that tells grep to include 3 lines of context after each matching line. In other words, it will show the line with "root" as well as the three lines that come after it in the file.
"root" is the search pattern that grep looks for.
/etc/passwd is the path to the file that grep searches in. This file stores information about user accounts, including usernames, user IDs, and other details.
